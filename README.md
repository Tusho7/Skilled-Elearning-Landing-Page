## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout and page responsiveness.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

## My process

Create Header
Add logo and button
Add texts and images
Give images sizes and styles in CSS
Give texts font styles in CSS
Create hover effects in CSS
Create Media Queris

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries,Also used overflow rule in css, hover effects and linear-gradient for backgrounds, the main challenge that I overcame was to create responsive page that would work on mobile and tablet and create layout of images and texts specifically like it is shown in design. Also, I worked to use grids and finally I did it. 

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic,interactive and responsive projects.
